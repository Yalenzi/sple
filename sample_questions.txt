Pharmaceutical Sciences Practice Questions

1. What is the primary mechanism of action of aspirin?
A) COX-1 inhibition
B) COX-2 inhibition  
C) Both COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition
D) Prostaglandin synthesis enhancement

Answer: C
Explanation: Aspirin irreversibly inhibits both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes, which are responsible for prostaglandin synthesis.

2. Which dosage form provides the fastest drug absorption?
A) Tablets
B) Capsules
C) Intravenous injection
D) Topical cream

Answer: C
Explanation: Intravenous injection provides immediate 100% bioavailability as the drug is directly administered into the systemic circulation.

3. What is the half-life of a drug?
A) Time for drug concentration to reach maximum
B) Time for 50% of the drug to be eliminated from the body
C) Time for drug to start working
D) Time for drug to be completely eliminated

Answer: B
Explanation: Half-life (t½) is the time required for the plasma concentration of a drug to decrease by 50% during the elimination phase.

4. Which factor does NOT affect drug absorption?
A) pH of the stomach
B) Blood flow to absorption site
C) Drug's molecular weight
D) Patient's hair color

Answer: D
Explanation: Patient's hair color has no physiological impact on drug absorption. Factors like pH, blood flow, and molecular weight significantly affect absorption.

5. What is bioequivalence?
A) Two drugs having the same chemical structure
B) Two drugs having the same therapeutic effect
C) Two drugs having similar bioavailability profiles
D) Two drugs having the same side effects

Answer: C
Explanation: Bioequivalence means that two pharmaceutical products have similar bioavailability when administered at the same dose under similar conditions.

Clinical Pharmacology Questions

6. Which drug interaction mechanism involves competition for the same enzyme?
A) Pharmacokinetic interaction
B) Pharmacodynamic interaction
C) Pharmaceutical interaction
D) Physiological interaction

Answer: A
Explanation: Pharmacokinetic interactions occur when one drug affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of another drug, including enzyme competition.

7. What is the therapeutic index?
A) LD50/ED50
B) ED50/LD50
C) Maximum dose/Minimum dose
D) Toxic dose/Effective dose

Answer: A
Explanation: Therapeutic index is the ratio of the median lethal dose (LD50) to the median effective dose (ED50), indicating the safety margin of a drug.

8. Which route of administration avoids first-pass metabolism?
A) Oral
B) Sublingual
C) Rectal (lower portion)
D) Both B and C

Answer: D
Explanation: Sublingual and lower rectal routes bypass the liver, avoiding first-pass metabolism, unlike oral administration.

9. What does Cmax represent in pharmacokinetics?
A) Minimum effective concentration
B) Maximum plasma concentration
C) Concentration at steady state
D) Clearance maximum

Answer: B
Explanation: Cmax is the maximum (peak) plasma concentration achieved after drug administration.

10. Which factor increases drug clearance?
A) Kidney disease
B) Liver disease
C) Increased hepatic blood flow
D) Advanced age

Answer: C
Explanation: Increased hepatic blood flow enhances drug clearance by improving drug delivery to metabolizing enzymes in the liver.

Pharmaceutical Calculations

11. A patient weighs 70 kg and needs a drug dose of 5 mg/kg. What is the total dose?
A) 300 mg
B) 350 mg
C) 400 mg
D) 450 mg

Answer: B
Explanation: Total dose = 70 kg × 5 mg/kg = 350 mg

12. If a 250 mg tablet contains 80% active ingredient, how much active drug is present?
A) 180 mg
B) 200 mg
C) 220 mg
D) 240 mg

Answer: B
Explanation: Active drug = 250 mg × 0.80 = 200 mg

13. A solution contains 2% w/v of drug. How many grams are in 500 mL?
A) 5 g
B) 10 g
C) 15 g
D) 20 g

Answer: B
Explanation: 2% w/v means 2 g per 100 mL. In 500 mL: (2 g/100 mL) × 500 mL = 10 g

14. What is the concentration if 50 mg is dissolved in 250 mL?
A) 0.1 mg/mL
B) 0.2 mg/mL
C) 0.3 mg/mL
D) 0.4 mg/mL

Answer: B
Explanation: Concentration = 50 mg ÷ 250 mL = 0.2 mg/mL

15. A prescription calls for 30 tablets, each containing 25 mg. What is the total amount of drug?
A) 650 mg
B) 700 mg
C) 750 mg
D) 800 mg

Answer: C
Explanation: Total drug = 30 tablets × 25 mg/tablet = 750 mg
